**sketch_builder.py**

defines a class `SketchBuilder` that is used to create sketches in the Excalidraw format. Excalidraw is a whiteboard tool that lets you easily sketch diagrams with a hand-drawn feel.

Here's a brief overview of the key methods in the `SketchBuilder` class:

- `__init__` and `refresh`: These methods initialize and reset the sketch builder, respectively.

- `add_element`: This method adds a new element (like a shape or line) to the sketch.

- `export_to_file`: This method exports the sketch to a file in the Excalidraw format.

- `create_bounding_element`: This method creates a bounding box around a given element or group of elements.

- `create_text_block`: This method creates a block of text elements from a list of strings.

- `order_sequence`, `order_below`, `order_above`, `order_left`, `order_right`: These methods arrange elements in a specific order.

- `horizontal_align` and `vertical_align`: These methods align elements horizontally or vertically.

- `create_binding_arrows`: This method creates an arrow between two elements.

- `render_networkx_graph`: This method renders a graph using the networkx library.

- `render_stack_sketch` and `_node_recursive_call`: These methods render a stack sketch, which is a specific type of diagram.

- `render_comparitive_stack_sketch` and `_decorate_config_box`: These methods render a comparative stack sketch, which is used to compare multiple stack sketches.

The script also imports several modules at the beginning, including `json` for handling JSON data, `math` and `numpy` for mathematical operations, `random` for generating random numbers, and `primitives` and `color_utils` for creating sketch elements and colors.
